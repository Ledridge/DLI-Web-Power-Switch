Users:
To properly compile and execute, it requires the HttpClient library from
Apache to be in the classpath. It can be found here:
http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi
I downloaded version 4.03, the Binary with Dependencies, but I believe
any 4.x version should work. HttpClient 3.x versions will not work, as
the API is different.

Thanks,
Nick
